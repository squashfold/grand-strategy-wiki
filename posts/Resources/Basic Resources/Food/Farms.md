Farms will produce [[Food]] to either be consumed by your [[Population]] directly, or to be used in another buildings [[Production Chain]].

## Resource outputs of Farms

Farms will output the dominant grain of the region, i.e. wheat in Europe or rice in East Asia.

###  Primary output types

- [[Rice]]
- [[Wheat]]
- [[Maize]]
- [[Barley]]
- [[Sorghum]]

#### Secondary output types

Some farms - depending on how many [[Building Levels]] it has, will produce a crop other than the primary output. This will be an item considered to be one of the [[Luxury Resources]].

Allocation of secondary output resource will be decided based on the current [[Market Price]] for each item on the list.

> [!For example]
> 
> A farm has reached a high enough level to be able to support a [[Secondary Output]]. When this happens, it will choose the most profitable out of the available output choices. This time it chose [[Fruit]] as that had the highest [[Market Price]] at the time. However, after a few months of producing fruit, the price has dropped to the point it is no longer profitable.
> 
> The farm will either switch to another more profitable secondary output which will need time to ramp up production, or if no profitable secondary production choice is available it will cease to provide the product.
> 
> A farm will only choose to produce an unprofitable secondary resource if that resource is subsidised to the point of creating a profit for the farm.
