#Politics

A [[Political System]] based around the concept of the general population choosing those who govern them.

There are varying levels of "Democracy", some that are highly representative and return a government the people vote for, others are only superficially democratic, with many caveats and exclusions in place as to who is considered a member of the [[Electorate]].
