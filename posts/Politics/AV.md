#Politics

This is a voting system very similar in style to [[STV]], however it runs in a [[FPTP]] style single winner takes all constituency system.

- The voting system closely resembles [[STV]] in X ways
	- The [[Electorate]] has the choice of multiple votes to give preferentially.
	- The [[Vote Share]] is tallied up, if no candidate reaches a higher than 50% majority, the candidate with the lowest [[Vote Share]] is eliminated and their votes redistributed to their second preferences.
		- This process continues until a candidate achieves the required majority threshold.
