This is a [[Voting System]] that is characterised by a "winner takes all approach".

- Members of the [[Legislature]] are elected on a "majority" vote.
	- This is simply the most votes in a [[Constituency]]
	- The more [[Candidates]] that contest the seat, the less [[Vote Share]] is needed in order to win the most votes.
