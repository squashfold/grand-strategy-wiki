#Politics

This is a [[Voting System]] characterised by a more proportional distribution of [[Vote Share]] so that the outcome is more closely aligned to how the [[Electorate]] voted.

This voting system creates multiple multi-member [[Constituency]] contests. Where multiple [[Elected Officials]] are returned to sit in the [[Legislature]].

- Members of the [[Legislature]] are elected on a majority basis, however there is a certain threshold of the [[Vote Share]] that the candidate has to reach.
	- This is calculated by dividing 100% by how many [[Elected Officials]] are to be returned.
	- The candidates contest in multiple rounds of [[Voting]] where the [[Electorate]] has ranked the candidates by order of preference. (This has similarities to the [[AV]] voting system).
	- The lowest performing candidate by [[Vote Share]] is eliminated and their votes redistributed to other [[Candidates]] based on voter preference.
		- This process is repeated until enough candidates have passed the minimum threshold to be elected.
		- If a candidate for a [[Political Party]] surpasses the threshold - any votes over the threshold are automatically redistributed to their second preferences and so on throughout the consecutive rounds of voting.
